# Tutorial 

1. **Download the Script from GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.

2. **Upload the Script to Your Server:**
   - Use an FTP client or SSH to transfer the extracted script files to your server.
   - Navigate to the directory where your FiveM server's resources are stored. This is usually in the `resources` directory of your server.

3. **Configure Your Server:**
   - Open the `server.cfg` file in a text editor.
   - Add the name of the script's folder (the one you just uploaded) to the `resources` section of your `server.cfg`. For example:
     ```
     ensure your-script-folder-name
     ```
   - Save the `server.cfg` file.

4. **Start Your Server:**
   - Start or restart your FiveM server. The script should now be loaded automatically.

5. **Test Your Script:**
   - Join your server and test your script to ensure everything is working as expected.

6. **Inspiration Note:**
   - You can also add a note in your README or script files mentioning the inspiration for your script. For example:
     ```
     This script is a remake of the steffone_armour script by STF-steffone (https://github.com/STF-steffone/steffone_armour).
     ```
